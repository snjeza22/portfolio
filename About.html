    <p>With a very stressfull and fast paced work I have done in years, traveling became one of the ways to achive balance and peace.
        It is important to learn about others cultures and open your mind for any challanges that life can put on your path.  One particular
        thing about the culture is the food. I have passion for food therefore want to know how food is prepared and
        how it is done. Obviously, I all love to eat.</p>
    <h1>YOGA & MARTIAL ARTS</h1>

    <p>Second thing beneficial for finding balance and inner peace is Yoga. People will say : "In a health body there is a healthy mind". Yoga does this for me. I grew love for Martial Art since I was 6 years old. Though me of resiliance, to be prepared for anything anymoment. Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.
